## World Wise App

### About:

WorldWise is a travel tracking tool that helps you create a visual record of your adventures. You can add cities to your list and view them on a world map, as well as access information about each city.

To use the application, you need to give permission to the device location. The app uses the Leaflet open-source library to display the map.

The application fetches cities from `data/cities.json`.
